# Autism-Prediction-in-ML-Using-Embeddings-
n this project, we developed a machine learning pipeline to predict the likelihood of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) based on genomic data. We focused on gene-level analysis by utilizing pre-trained gene symbol embeddings, which capture semantic and functional relationships between genes in a high-dimensional vector space.
