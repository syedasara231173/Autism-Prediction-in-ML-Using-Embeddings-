# Autism Risk Prediction using Gene Symbol Embeddings
This project aims to predict the likelihood of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) using machine learning models applied to gene symbol embeddings. Instead of relying on traditional categorical gene representations, we use vector embeddings that capture semantic and biological relationships between genes. These embeddings serve as numerical input features to train and evaluate ML models for classifying ASD-related genetic variants.

# Key Features
Gene Embedding Integration: Transformed gene symbols into high-dimensional vectors using pretrained embeddings.

ASD Classification: Labeled dataset includes both pathogenic (ASD-associated) , benign , likely benign and likely pathogenic variants.

ML Models Used: **Random Forest**

Performance Evaluation: Focused on precision, recall, and F1-score for biomedical classification accuracy.
This model shows 94% accuracy in our results

Biological Relevance: Demonstrates how vectorized gene data can improve ASD risk prediction and genomic analysis.

# Objective
To explore the power of gene embeddings in enhancing autism risk prediction and demonstrate the applicability of ML in genomics.
